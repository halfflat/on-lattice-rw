a neuron_collection_data_AAAlattice_runBBB_XXXbyYYYbyZZZ_CCCn.csv
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
is a csv of the coordinates of each lattice point occupied by each neuron object from a intersect_branch_to_optomise_wk8.py simulation

AAA - describes the lattice shape
BBB - describes the run number (each csv will only contain the results for one neuron branching simulation)
XXX - max x ordinate of the lattice
YYY - max z ordinate of the lattice
ZZZ - max z ordinate of the lattice
CCC - the number of neurons placed on the lattice at t=0

The output contains:
neuron_name(arbitrary number), -self explanatory, counts the neurons in the simulation
x, -the position of the point described by this row belonging to neuron_name of the same row
y,
z,
parent_x, - the position of the neuron at time_added_to_neuron-1 which grew into this rows point(x,y,z)(for root this is the same as x)
parent_y,
parent_z,
time_added_to_neuron, -the time step of the simulation at which the point belonging to the neuron_name was added 
is_root, -a boolean indicator
is_childless, -a boolean indicator if this point belonging to neuron_name has no children
is_branch, -a boolean indicator describing if this point belonging to neuron_name is the parent of more than one point(the neuron grew twice at the same timestep from this point)
is_intersection, -a boolean indicator describing if this point is shared by other neuron_name s

(alt_)lengths_(branched/terminated)_cables_DDDr_AAA_XXXbyYYYbyZZZ_CCCn.txt
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a list of all the lengths of cables that will branch/terminate collated for a AAA_XXXbyYYYbyZZZ_CCCn simulation performed(independantly(starting positions of neurons and growing choices are different randoms between simulations)) DDD number of times

follows the same naming convention as above except here instead of sepeating files by runs, all runs are combined and so
DDD - describes the number of runs that the txt file (think of it more as a list) of cable lengths will collate, how many lattices had neuron growing simulations performed on them
branched - only information for cables that will branch stored
terminated - only information for cables that will terminate stored
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

actual_number_of_runs.txt 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
describes how many runs were actually performed and stored in an (alt_)lengths_(branched/terminated)_cables_DDDr_AAA_XXXbyYYYbyZZZ_CCCn.txt file as they are named 100r even if they are not yet at 100r
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

plot_length_vs_frequency.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
plots length vs frequency for cable lengths from (alt_)lengths_(branched/terminated)_cables_DDDr_AAA_XXXbyYYYbyZZZ_CCCn.txt 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
